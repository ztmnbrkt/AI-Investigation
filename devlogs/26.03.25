so i think its working, but batches arent and im not sure how they should.
scalling back for now to have a somewhat functioning project. but i need 
to shuffle the data so the network classifies more than just zeros.
also convolutional layer outputs 1*26*26 when stride=1 for some reason???

fixed the convolutional, there were alot of errors due to not instantiating 
things like dX correctly. Also, there was an error in the logic for how to 
handle input shapes [i, h, w] and [h, w], fixed those with the "testing" 
blocks. another error was dX defaulted to unit8 datatype, changed it to 
float.

next need to do the onehot encoding for the error functions, then try and
save and load the networks with a csv.
