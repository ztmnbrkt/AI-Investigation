    error:  dense layer gives dim error on forward function
    bug:    forgot to split the data into batches, reulting in a single layer recieving the entire training
            set...
    fix:    split the data into batches, set training loop to account for batches

    bug: i forgot to flatten the inputs per image, and not per batch, in the dense layers.
    fix:  fix the flattening function, loop around batches

    so far, the prediction algo works when inputting an image. now testing batches...
