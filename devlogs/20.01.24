python is really wierd. coming from C++ and C#, not defining what your variables are can be really 
confusing, but its a real help when your constantly passing around different classes. apparently 
you need the ABC package to make abstract classes and abstract functions? 

I've also realised that im missing a whole section of research into calculating loss. todolist for this:
- loss 
    - categorical cross entropy:
        categorical cross entropy is an implementation of corss entropy integrated with softmax,
        a way of measuring how wrong your predictions are relative to all other classes.
    
    - cross entropy:
        using onehot encoding and prob. distributions, calculates the scale of the loss of a bad prediction:
            Loss(estimations, target) = sum x of target * log(estimations * x)


-- usage:
    is calculated at the final layer and is used for the entire network on the backprop.
