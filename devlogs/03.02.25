so, packaging in python is really confusing. it took me an hour to realise that i was 
importing a file and usig it as a class instead of importing the class itself...

init files are important in making each package easy to use. i cut out "activations" 
dependancy on "layers" for troubleshooting, i think ill keep it this way.
