there's a lot of small things, mainly about python and how it 
works, that people forget or dont bother to explain. heres a 
list that should be included in the writeup:
    - calling [matrix].shape returns its shape as an array of
      rank of however many dimesions it has, the magnitude of 
      each being that of the dimension. for example;
        a batch of three channel 28x28 bit images (coloured 
        images) would return [1, 3, 28, 28]
    - when people say dX, they're really saying dE/dX, or the
      gradient of the error with respect to some variable. 
      more simply, how quickly the error increases for at the 
      value of a variable.
