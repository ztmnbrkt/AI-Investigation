# AI-Investigation
An Investigation into some machine learning algos. ANN's, Convolution, Recurrence, etc.

The goal of this investigation is to compare 3 different networks on 3 different datasets, comparing efficiency (time to train/error rate) and the effect of convolution on a network.

My real purpose for this is to have deeper understanding of neural networks, what better way to learn than to program a few myself! 

also idk how to use github.

ToDo:
 - Layers
 -x Base
 -x Dense
 -x ReLU
 -- Sigmoid
 -x Softmax
 -x Convolutional

 - Networks
 -- Layer Array? 

 - Datasets
 -- Data Normalisation
 
 - I/O (Import/Export to CSV)

 - testing
