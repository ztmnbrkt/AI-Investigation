# AI-Investigation
An Investigation into some machine learning algos. ANN's, Convolution, Recurrence, etc.

The goal of this investigation is to compare 3 different networks on 3 different datasets, comparing efficiency (time to train/error rate) and the effect of convolution on a network. 

ToDo:
 - Layers
 -x Base
 --- Forward
 --- Backward
 -x Dense
 
 - Activation (layer)
 -- ReLU
 -- Sigmoid
 -- Softmax
 -- Convolutional
 -- MaxPool
 --

 - Networks
 -- Layer Array

 - Datasets
 -- Data Normalisation
 
 - I/O (Import/Export to CSV)
